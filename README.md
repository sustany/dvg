The objective of this project is to develop a taxonomy and ontology to bridge the gap between digital solutions aiming to facilitate human economic activity and the practical requirements needed to enforce obligations in the physical realm - i.e. provide (digital) documentation ('evidence') which holds up legally in the relevant jurisdictions.
Interoperability of digital solutions needs to necessarily start on the natural language level, moving to the semantic level (where necessary within the appropriate discipline), further to linguistics, and finally to high-level coding language. - As such we are starting with a simple Wiki, and list of terms which require IRL definitions before creating project outlines for (decentralized) software solutions, in particular blockchains and graphs.
The wider objective is to facilitate the development of a human-centered network (web), in which individuals regain control over the feedback mechanisms technologies provide to them.

Please note: this is **not** a philosophical 'exercise' but rather a practical approach, which presupposes that a central tenet of innovation through technology is the increase of human productivity, freeing up individuals attention ([agency](https://github.com/sustany/dvg/wiki/Agency)) - measured in time - that these can (deliberately) assign to leisure activities or higher order pursuits, such as the accumulation of knowledge or wealth. 

For the current state of the taxonomy see the [Wiki](https://github.com/sustany/dvg/wiki).
