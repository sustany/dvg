The narrow objective of this project is to develop a taxonomy to bridge the gab between digital solutions aiming to fascilitae human economic activity and the practical requirements needed to enforce obligations in the physical realm - i.e. "provide evidence which (legally) holds up (in there relevant jurisdiction(s)).
Interoperability needs to necessarily start on the natural language level, moving to the semantic level (where necessary within the appropriate discipline), further to linguistics, and finally to high-level coding language. - As such we are starting with a simple Wiki, and list of terms which require IRL definitions before creating project outlines for (decentralzied) software solutions (i.e. blockchains and graphs).
The wider opjective is to fascilitae the development of a human-centered network (web), in which individuals regain control over the feedback mechansims technologies provide to them.

Note: this is NOT a philosohpical 'exercise' but rather a practical approach, which presiposes that a central tenet of innovation through technology is the increase of human productivity, freeing up individuals attention - measured in time - that these can (deliberatelly) assign to leisure activities or higher order pursuits, such as the accumulation of knowledge or wealth.
