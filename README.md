The objective of this project is to develop a taxonomy to bridge the gab between digital solutions aiming to fascilitae human economic activity and the practical requirements needed to enforce obligations in the physical realm - i.e. "provide evidence which (legally) holds up (in there relevant jurisdiction(s)).
Interoperability needs to necessarily start on the natural language level, moving to the semantic level (where necessary within the appropriate discipline), further to linguistics, and finally to high-level coding language. - As such we are starting with a simple Wiki, and list of terms which require IRL definitions before creating project outlines for (decentralzied) software solutions (i.e. blockchains and graphs).
